# Patient-Heart-Stroke-Prediction
This repository is devoted to predicting the likelihood of a patient experiencing a heart stroke using Logistic Regression, a robust machine learning algorithm. The project's primary objective is to analyze a diverse set of health-related features and leverage a logistic regression model to classify patients into potential stroke risk categories.
